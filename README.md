# Amnesia üëÅÔ∏è 

---

Are you tired of Google (and every other browser vendor) holding onto your Browse history like a digital hoarder? Do you wish for a clean slate every time you close your browser, but don't want to sacrifice the convenience of keeping your cookies? Well, my friend, you've found your digital salvation!

**Amnesia** is a lightweight, yet mighty, Google Chrome and Chromium-based browser extension that does one thing, and does it exceptionally well: **it wipes your Browse history clean every time you exit your browser.** That's right, total amnesia for your past Browse escapades, while keeping your precious cookies intact.

## Why "Amnesia"?

Because we're fixing something Google apparently doesn't want to fix! While incognito mode is a thing, it's a temporary solution. I believe you should have persistent control over your Browse history without jumping through hoops.

Icon is from Microsoft FluentUI Pack.

## Features

* **Automatic History Deletion:** Say goodbye to your Browse history the moment you close your browser.
* **Cookie Retention:** Keep your login sessions and site preferences without losing them after every restart.
* **Lightweight & Efficient:** Runs in the background without hogging your system resources.
* **Simple & Effective:** No complicated settings, just install and enjoy Browse freedom.

## Installation

1.  **Download the extension:**
    * (Coming soon to the Chrome Web Store!)
    * For now, you can clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/cttynul/amnesia.git`
2.  **Open your browser's extensions page:**
    * In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`
    * In Brave, go to `brave://extensions/`
    * In Edge, go to `edge://extensions/`
3.  **Enable "Developer mode"** (usually a toggle in the top right corner).
4.  **Click "Load unpacked"** and select the folder where you cloned (or unzipped) the extension.

That's it! You're ready to experience true Browse privacy.

## How it Works

Amnesia listens for the browser's "onSuspend" event, which is triggered when the browser is about to close. At that moment, it swiftly clears your Browse history, leaving your cookies untouched. It's like magic, but with code!
